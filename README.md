# Certi.Web.App 

:: Workaround -

1. You Add events list to a Google sheet.

2. You Provide date and y-axis offset for name in same events sheet.

3. You provide certificate image and participants list for each event in separate drive folder.

4. Nosql Database is generated/updated (firebase) for every change smartly.

5. React app makes request to a function hosted on AppScript and relevant data is returned.

6. Generate certificate is generated at client side with the information received.

7. A hashed code too is generated for future verification of certificate.
